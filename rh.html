    <h1>The rocking horse winner by D.H Lawrence</h1>
    <h3>Luca</h3>
    <div style="backgroundcolor: blue; border: 5mm solid white;">
      <div style="backgroundcolor: green; border: 5mm solid white;">There is this unloving mother that pretends to love her children for social status and spends a bunch of money that they can't afford to. Then this stupid conversation happens between the mum and her son about luck and he decides to be lucky. He then proceeds to start betting on horse races and winning because he just knows which one is gonna win. Then goes though the predictable slump that most characters do in the middle of a story so he doesn't win anything. When it's almost time for this really big horse race thing to happen the boy rides this random wooden horse from his childhood so he can know what horse will win. Unfortunately his mum scares him while doing that and he hits his head or something and dies later in the hospital after winning that aforementioned big horse race.</di>
